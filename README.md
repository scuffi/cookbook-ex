# Installation & Usage

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

To install, clone this repo and navigate into the root directory of it _(the directory that contains `package.json`)_

Then to view the UI, use

```
npm start
```

Now you can view the client at [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000)

_Note: This is a development build, to create a production build, use `npm run build`_

# Testing

There are unit tests built in to each component, to run these tests use

```
npm test
```
